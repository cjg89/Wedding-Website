                <h3>Ceremony &amp; Reception Information</h3>
                
                <img class="alignright padbreak_top" src="img/photo_venue.jpg" alt="The Destin Bay House" title="The Destin Bay House" />
                
                <p>Both the wedding ceremony and reception will take place at the Destin Bay House.  The Destin Bay House is situated right on the western edge of Destin, just past the Destin Bridge on Calhoun Avenue.  For those of you in Jo’s family, the venue is right next door to Clement Taylor Park (where we’ve had many of our family reunions.)</p>
                
                <p>Both our families are pretty lax southern folks-- this wedding will be very casual.  Dress will be your typical “Sunday best” clothing.  Kids are welcome to attend.  Food will include burgers, hotdogs, chicken, etc.  Beer and wine will also be served.  If you have any food allergies and need to make a special request, please do so when you RSVP.</p>
                
                <p>The Bay House offers parking for up to 27 vehicles; two of these spots are handicap reserved.  Additional parking will be available at the nearby First Presbyterian Church.  If possible, please carpool with other guests to help others find adequate parking.</p>

                <p>Please note that smoking is NOT PERMITTED inside OR on the screened-in porch.  Designated smoking areas will be available outside.  Please discard all cigarette butts properly (don’t let them burn out in the dirt.)</p>
                
                <p>The ceremony will take place outside in the back green, barring inclement weather.  We’ll begin the ceremony at 5:30pm. The reception will follow shortly thereafter.  After photos are taken, guests will be free to wander inside the Bay House and onto the green as they please.  We plan on wrapping up the reception between 8-8:30pm.</p>

                <p>I’m a 22-year-old web designer and developer.  I graduated in May 2011 from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor’s in Digital Interactive Systems.  I currently work for my alma mater as a Web Applications Programmer for their marketing department.</p>

				<p>Raised in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, I am a small-town girl in a big, daunting city.  I enjoy taking trips back to my hometown to visit my family whenever I can.</p>

            	<h3>How We Met</h3>
                
                <p>Oddly, Trey and I didn’t meet until after we’d moved down to Orlando for college, even through we’re both from Northwest Florida.  Some friends from high school were 
getting together for dinner and a movie a day or two after we’d arrived at Orlando.  There were about 8 of us; one of our friends invited Trey.  We didn’t talk much until after dinner, when we’d gotten to the movie theater-- before the movie, I noticed a Galaga machine set up near the theater entrance.  I immediately dug out my quarters and tore away at the joystick.  Trey apparently thought it was cute that I was into video games and started making chit-chat with me as I played.  Little did I know that this would lead to months of attempts to win my heart.  It took me a while to reciprocate, but by January of 2009 we were dating, and the rest is history.</p>
